 Word guessing game: Wizarding World edition

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://siaesin.github.io/msp1_wordgame/>.


## Project Description

As a certified Potterhead, I love Harry Potter Trivia. I didn't want to do a multiple choice type of trivia but I definitely wanted to test the players knowledge. I came across Code with Ania Kubów and her trivia app game but it was a little advanced for me. She also had a Wordle copy and that made me think of a word guessing game. The player would still need to use the hints/questions but I could more easily control the answer they give. 
There were a few word guessing games that were able to provide inspiration and give me a good direction. The two main ones are listed in the code. 


## Game Logic
Using the hint/question, guess the letters to spell out the answer. Will you prove yourself to be an exceptional Witch or Wizard or are you a muggle?
This is intended as a single player game but you can play with friends as well. 
When you select a correct letter it will show up in the appropriate box. If you choose an incorrect letter, it will move to the letter graveyard.  You get between 5 - 8 chances depending on the length of the word. You win when you find the answer.

## Deliverables

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- stretch goal:
  afterwards or bonus: difficulty selector. maybe a house selector
  extra hint button and pop-up(?) maybe
  timer?
- Another that will be a stretch.
  issues: multi word answers????
  change backgrounds ?  woohoo DONE!
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
