## General Requirements


- This game must run in a web browser.
- This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum of 10 commits.
- Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
- This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.


## Game Requirements

- The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE).
  - The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)
  - For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way).
  - When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts.
  - If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.
- The HTML code should use sematic tags.



# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL GOES HERE>.


## Project Description

As a certified Potterhead, I love Harry Potter Trivia. I didn't want to do a multiple choice type of trivia but I definitely wanted to test the players knowledge. I came across Code with Ania Kub√≥w and her trivia app game but it was a little advanced for me. She also had a Wordle copy and that made me think of a word guessing game. The player would still need to use the hints/questions but I could more easily control the answer they give. 
There were a few word guessing games that were able to provide inspiration and give me a good direction. The two main ones are listed in the code. 


## Game Logic
Using the hint/question, guess the letters to spell out the answer. Will you prove yourself to be an exceptional Witch or Wizard or are you a muggle?
This is intended as a single player game but you can play with friends as well. 
When you select a correct letter it will show up in the appropriate box. If you choose an incorrect letter, it will move to the letter graveyard.  You get between 5 - 8 chances depending on the length of the word. You win when you find the answer.

## Deliverables

**[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
### MVP Criteria
- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
Guess the word - Wizarding World edition
    title  
    score (puzzles completed)
    letter/answer area
    clue/question
    guesses remaining
    guessed letters
    restart game

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- stretch goal:
  afterwards or bonus: difficulty selector. maybe a house selector
  extra hint button and pop-up(?) maybe
  timer?
- Another that will be a stretch.
  issues: multi word answers????
  change backgrounds ?  woohoo DONE!
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
